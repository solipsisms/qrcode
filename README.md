## My process

Since I haven't had much experience with actually putting my HTML and CSS knowledge together, it was a lot of changing things around and seeing how it would change. I found a live server extension on VS Code that was super useful. If I wasn't sure if something was actually possible or not, I would Google it.

### Built with

-HTML

-CSS

-Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned the capabilites of CSS can really enahnce your HTML to a whole other level. I have built a lot of websites with just HTML running a Python script in the past, but I have never focused on the more aesthetic side. This project wasn't easy, but it makes me feel excited for the true capabilites in web-developemnt.

### Continued development

I really want to go back at this code and figure out what each line is doing. I feel like my organization skills here were not that great, as I was trying to figure everything out all at once. 

### Useful resources

https://www.w3schools.com/ was a HUGE resource for me. It has a lot of basic information, very helpful in my limited experience with CSS.

## Acknowledgments

Arekkusu17's code was what turned my whole project around. I didn't know what Flexboxes were and it helped me with the alignment of everything so much.
